        <li>
            Header: <b>Complete </b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Go to the home page, at the root of the website, which should be called index: <b>Complete </b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first page should NOT have class material/content on it: <b>Complete </b> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Within the course website (but not nested further in folders) there should be an index page: <b>Complete </b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then on this page and all standard pages:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            link element with relative URL to styles/default.css: <b>Complete </b>
                        <li>
                            All nav links work and are functional.
                        </li>

    <p>The website demonstrates thorough attention to detail in its structure, ensuring each page adheres to essential standards. Navigation is seamless, with clear links and titles guiding users throughout. Its vibrant design, complemented by effective use of color and layout principles, creates an engaging user experience. However, optimizing image loading times could enhance overall performance, while adding validation buttons to the footer would further enhance accessibility and compliance.
