        <h3><a href="https://www.tesla.com">Tesla</a></h3>
        <p>
            <b>Tesla's website showcases electric vehicles, energy products, and solar solutions.</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website showcases its current lineup of electric cars, energy products, and solar solutions by employing distinctive design elements to differentiate each product.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The elements maintain uniformity and elegance, presenting each product with a consistent aesthetic.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Each product is aligned with one another, creating a cohesive product page where elements seamlessly connect.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Vehicle products are grouped together,energy products are grouped together, and solar products are grouped together, effectively creating three distinct product lineups through strategic organization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Tesla website excels in contrast, using a clean and modern design. Repetition is evident in consistent branding elements. Alignment is well-maintained, contributing to a visually pleasing layout. Proximity is effectively utilized to group related information, enhancing user experience.

        <h3><a href="https://craigslist.org">Craigslist</a></h3>
        <p>
            <b>Craigslist is a widely-used online marketplace that facilitates local buying, selling, and trading of goods and services, serving as a platform for individuals and businesses to connect within their communities.</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Craigslist's design suffers from a lack of contrast between sections and elements within each section, contributing to confusion and an overall unpolished appearance due to its limited use of colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The consistent use of a single font color and limited variety results in a bland and outdated aesthetic, creating an impression of being unclean and unofficial due to the lack of visual interest caused by the absence of effective repetition in design elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> While the text within this website maintains proper alignment, the cluttered arrangement of categories and subcategories creates a disorganized and challenging browsing experience, highlighting a need for improved alignment in the structure of content to enhance clarity and ease of navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The website's lack of adherence to the proximity design principle leads to a cluttered and messy appearance, as unrelated elements are grouped together, compromising the overall visual organization and user experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Craigslist's design deficiencies, including a lack of contrast, color variation, repetition, and issues with alignment and proximity, create a confusing and outdated user experience.</p>
