            <h2>Screening Methods</h2>
            <p>Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms. Three screening tests have been studied to see if they decrease the risk of dying from lung cancer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT)</h3>
                    <p>A procedure that uses low-dose radiation to make a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x-ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path. This procedure is also called spiral scan or helical scan.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Effective at finding early-stage lung cancer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> False-positive results may lead to unnecessary invasive procedures, overdiagnosis of some lung cancers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Chest X-ray</h3>
                    <p>An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple and non-invasive.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Less effective at detecting early-stage lung cancer compared to LDCT, may result in false-negative and false-positive results.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Sputum Cytology</h3>
                    <p>A procedure in which a sample of sputum (mucus that is coughed up from the lungs) is viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Non-invasive.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Less effective than LDCT at detecting early-stage lung cancer, may result in false-negative and false-positive results.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Screening is Done</h2>
            <p>Screening for lung cancer is done with a yearly low-dose CT scan (LDCT). For this test, you lie on a thin, flat table that slides back and forth inside the hole in the middle of the CT scanner, which is a large, doughnut-shaped machine.</p>
            <p>As the table moves into the opening, an x-ray tube rotates within the scanner, sending out many tiny x-ray beams at precise angles. These beams quickly pass through your body and are detected on the other side of the scanner. A computer then converts these results into detailed images of the lungs.</p>
            <p>An LDCT scan is painless and only takes a few minutes, although the entire visit (including getting you ready and into place on the table) can take up to half an hour. You donâ€™t need to swallow anything or get any type of injection before this type of CT scan. LDCT does expose you to a small amount of radiation, although it is less than that from a standard CT scan.</p>
            <p>To learn more about CT scans and what getting one is like, see CT Scan for Cancer.</p>
            <p>If something abnormal is found during screening, more CT scans or other tests will be needed to be sure. Some of these tests are described in Tests for Lung Cancer.</p>
            <p>CT scans of the lungs can also sometimes show problems in other organs near the lungs. Your doctor will discuss any such findings with you if they are found.</p>
