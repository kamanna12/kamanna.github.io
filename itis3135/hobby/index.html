                <h3>Sustainable Energy and Climate Change</h3>
                <p>In this section, we delve into sustainable energy and sustainable transportation. Sustainable energy encompasses sources that do not deplete natural resources or harm the environment. Examples include solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, biomass energy, and geothermal energy. These sources are renewable and boast minimal environmental impact when contrasted with fossil fuels. Sustainable transportation, on the other hand, entails modes of transportation with reduced environmental footprints compared to conventional vehicles reliant on fossil fuels. Examples encompass electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid vehicles, bicycles, public transportation (such as buses and trains), and walking. These transportation alternatives play a pivotal role in curbing greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating air pollution, and decreasing reliance on non-renewable resources.</p>                <h3>Sustainable Transportation</h3>
                <p>Furthermore, the adoption of sustainable energy sources and transportation alternatives is crucial for addressing pressing environmental challenges and transitioning towards a more sustainable future. Governments, businesses, and individuals must prioritize investments in renewable energy infrastructure and incentivize the use of electric vehicles and other eco-friendly modes of transportation. By implementing policies such as tax incentives, rebates, and subsidies, governments can encourage the widespread adoption of sustainable practices. Businesses can also play a pivotal role by investing in research and development of clean technologies and incorporating sustainability into their operations and supply chains. Additionally, individuals can contribute by making conscious choices such as opting for renewable energy providers, utilizing public transportation, carpooling, or choosing to walk or bike whenever possible. By collectively embracing these alternatives and fostering a culture of sustainability, we can mitigate the impacts of climate change, reduce pollution, and preserve our planet for future generations.</p>            </div>

            <p>I employed AI primarily to generate images, descriptions, and certain formatting elements throughout this website. Utilizing AI, I incorporated features such as bubble highlights for the navigation bar tabs. Additionally, I leveraged AI to generate the paragraphs required for each section of this assignment. Overall, it was fascinating to witness the potency and utility of AI in website creation. Below, you'll find the various prompts I utilized, along with the corresponding sections where they were employed.</p>
            <p>I used ChatGPT 3.5 and Claude.AI for the paragraphs and some of the formatting. I used Canva AI Image Generator for the images throughout the webpage. Some of them are extremely well made but I fully used Canva for the images.</p>
